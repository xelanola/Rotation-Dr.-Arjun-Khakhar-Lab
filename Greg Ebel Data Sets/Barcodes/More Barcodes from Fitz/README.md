mg=midgut
sg=salivary gland
sl=saliva
12dpi=12 days post infection
4dpi=4 days post infection

Proceeding numbers are related to categorization of mosquitoes
Data consists of 33bp barcodes and their respective sequence counts

bcWNV files are inputs
estimated_input is all input barcodes and barcodes not in the input set with a Count of 1


2.  CSV Files

Original Files converted to CSV

3.   Alligned Barcodes

Has CSV files where all midgut counts are converted to a frequency (count/sum of counts)
Also has CSV file where instead it is the difference between midgut frequency and input frequency.

4.   Alligned Barcodes-50bp flaps

These files have 50bp of WNV sequence upstream and downstream of the barcode insertion position added to the barcodes
