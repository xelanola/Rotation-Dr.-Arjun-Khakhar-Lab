1. Barcodes

Dr. Ebel has completed experiments with 33bp barcoded sequences added to WNV genome at positions 7237 and 7269 in the genome. These barcoded viruses infected mosquitoes and then were sequenced. 

This model would be good for Optimus 5 Prime with enough data because the barcode is a clear input and the count, if converted to a frequency, is a good label.


2. Bird Passage

Dr. Ebel has completed experiments where wild perching birds (american crows, robins, and sparrows) were infected with WNV and then sequenced for single nucleotide or long polymorphisms.

The current data present is only for American Crows.

The Bird Passage Data was applied to Optimus 5 Prime with the hopes of predicting accumulated mutations.
However, ultimately it was not used because single nucleotide mutations do not carry association between each other.
This means that the model ultimately just learns that the specific mutations occur at those positions, and it does not learn
what the context by which those mutations are preferential at those positions over other mutations.
